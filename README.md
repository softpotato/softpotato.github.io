# Personal Blog

This is a personal blog that I'll be maintaining. You can access it in the following link below.

I'll be updating it occassionally to create my own tutorials, projects I'm working on, and general web tools for video games that I play. I might try prototyping a few games or coole UI stuff, but other than that I'll try to keep this to documenting programming related stuff I do.
