# Personal Blog

This is my blog I made in JavaScript. Not all the code is my own original, I followed various tutorials on the matter. I'll be adding

## TODO

This is a simple list of things that I probably will add into the project later on. Currently, it's a barebones blog with posts being readable.

- Tutorial section
- Post-mortem section
- About page
- Archive link to google drive
- contact mapping to social media
- improved webpage coloring theme
- add circle to jump to top of the page
- app bar to move main hyperlinks into
- canvas games

## Additional Credits

These are tutorials/templates online that I found where I copy/pasted or used it as reference for my webpage.
