# Creating Your Own GitHub Blog

Completion: 0%

This is a comprehensive guide to creating your own GitHub blog.
This guide is aimed at beginners who wish to learn React and
set up a simple blog to start their journey. 

We'll be focusing on the following topics and libraries in this
tutorial.
- JavaScript
- React
- Function Components
- Hooks
- Material UI library
- gh-pages library
- Static page loading
- Markdown
- react-markdown library + extensions
- Grids (Flexbox Wrappers)

Furthermore, I'll be avoiding the use of
images, since each github repo has a limited
amount of storage. I'm trying to keep things 
as small as possible. (Ironically though
writing in a wrapper for JavaScript probably
isn't the most efficient use of space)

## Installation and Setup of Page

_Step 1: Install Node Package Manager_

As with all JavaScript projects built using
React, we start with the installation of 
Node Package Manager (NPM). This is how 
packages are managed in React. We'll be
importing a lot of packages to write our
blog.

_Step 2: Run the initial react library setup_

Run the following command in your target directory.

```powershell
npx create-react-app <app name>
```
