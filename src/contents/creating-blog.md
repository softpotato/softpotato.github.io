# Creating Blog

This is going to be my first attempt at writing a blog. I'm mostly doing
this cause I remember a professor telling me to before I graduated to
start a blog, but I never really had time to set it up since I would need
to allocate time outside of school, which I didn't have, to set up this
blog.

Well, 2 months after graduation without a job or internship. I'm finally 
setting up the blog. I hope it'll help with my talking skills as I've
been reading online, but I'm not as confident this will really help with
anything.

I'll try to update this blog at the end of the week on Friday, so hopefully
I'll at least be consistent and not veg for a month or 2 because of interview
stress.

Also, I'll update this post later to have instructions for setting up the
blog if I'm successful at making this simple react webpage.
