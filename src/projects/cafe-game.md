# Cafe Game

I am currently focusing on creating simple tile maps, tile sets, and getting simple code to render the tilemaps in Pygame.

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame

This is a top-down pixel art simple game style. 
Akin to Stardew Valley, but with my own slight twist of being a cooking oriented game.
I have an idea on the cooking mechanics, but it just require a bunch of art to be created.
I might have to research into something like procedural pixel art generation.

Interestingly, I found a tutorial to make a Stardew Valley clone in Pygame.
I might use that for the basic top-down movement and tile setting, but I think that's about all I need from it.
