# Extension About

Extensions are more code heavy components of a post. 
I separated these because they're more of the heavy
lifter for a post listed in the "tools" section. These
posts require heavy amounts of state management which
would be super tedious and difficult to program in
solely through JSON specifications. It's possible, but
who the fuck would spend the time to learn and do
that with their posts. 

Anyways, I'll add stuff to here another time. There will
be an function that you need to register your extensions
here with.
