# Weird Note

The stuff in this folder is not content, but webpage render stuff.
Like say you wanted a progress bar added into the content of the
webpage. Say you wanted some tool. This is sort of that stuff
related to the webpage, but not necessarily necessary for the
webpage to function. If you see anything in this folder, feel
free to disregard or copy it. I don't care. I'm mostly adding
an extension so I can render a webpage with the tool to display
matrices from leetcode. I'm super frustrated with looking at
text display of matrices.
