# First Blog Post!

_Posted: 8/13/2022_

I finally set up enough of the code to get the blog up and
running on github! This will also be my first time writing a blog!

## Future Plans 

I will update at least once a week. I plan on focusing on the 4 things
throughout the week.

- Leetcode Stuff
- Pygame cafe game
- Encrypted text file editor in UWP
- GitHub blog Updates/Tutorial

**Leetcode** because I just need to get better at algorithms in general.

**Pygame** becuase I just wanted to make a game and get better at OOP in general.

**Encrypted Text Editor** so I can write my fanfic without the fear of anyone reading it.

**GitHub blog stuff** cause I'll write a tutorial and update this simple web app.

I'll also try to work on some open source projects while I'm at it, but I'm not sure what I'd
be able to post about. I'll mostly be trying to work on minetest, but I make no guarantee that
I'll do anything significant at the moment. opengl c++ stuff might be out of my league atm,
but I'm willing to learn/try.
