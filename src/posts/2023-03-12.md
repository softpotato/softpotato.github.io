# Feeling Clouded

_Created: March 12th, 2023_

I haven't been feeling well, emotionally, these past few months.
I'm worried that I can't find a job, and that I'll never get one at this rate. 
Sometimes hugs don't make things better...

I've been reflecting on things I can do to work on myself.
I plan on adding my college projects to this github page this week.
I finally mustered up the motivation to do so. 
I'll try my best to put all the work up, but there might be some where I just don't have the files left.
I also plan on revising my resume to make it more targeted and specialized.
I think I have too much random shit on my resume that it doesn't reflect well on some of the jobs I'm applying to.

On the plus side of being clouded for the past 2-4 months, I've been making solid progress on Leet Code.
I wrote a solution a few days ago, and I feel not terrible for writing it.
I'm semi-confident in BFS/DFS problems and binary search. 
I suck at dynamic programming, and I'm so-so at 2 pointers.
There are a few though that worry me, like the next permutation problem.
The logic behind it is wild and the algorithms make sense.
I remember coming upon a similar, but not complete take on it, but I'm not sure I'll be able to invent an algorithm during an interview.
I'm even more worried in my lack of capabilities to explain my code, since I primarily work on it at home, alone.

Also, I think I'll pick back up my C++ SDL2 game engine project and to keep searching for open source projects.
I really have no confidence in myself to contribute, because whenever I see any projects on GitHub.
I always see what looks like an amazing work that many people are contributing to, but I'm not sure if I can help in any way.
I don't speak multiple languages, so I can't help with translating documentation.
I'm a pretty crappy programmer, like I struggled to strew together my capstone project that was a simple front end web tool application.
And, I just don't really know where to start in many cases.
I sort of feel like a piece of waste right now, and that I won't be able to contribute anything.
I'll try on Wednesday, but I might just focus more on my webpage instead.

Oh right.
This is completely unrelated to anything, but I've been practicing Duolingo every day for the past ~180 days I think.
I also have the Japanese language keyboard pack installed, so I can attach random Japanese characters to my posts.
I've been learning it so I can read comics without having to wait for translators to translate.
I'll add 1 random word every time I write a post.

For this post, my word will be　さようなら (sa-yo-u-na-ra), which means goodbye in Japanese.

Ah, now I sorta want to learn Korean, to read Korean comics, and Mandarin Chinese, so I can go back to Taiwan and talk with my relatives.
