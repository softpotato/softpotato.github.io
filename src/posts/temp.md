# Post Purge Post

I purged my blog. I don't think any of my previous posts were useful for anything. Anyways, I'm still in the process of updating my blog (at the time I'm writing this), but I've reworked the section pages and added a search feature to the webpage. I also plan on introducing a history section so if I ever make enough tutorials, you can easily pick back up from where you left off.
