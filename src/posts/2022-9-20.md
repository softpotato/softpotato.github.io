# 9/20/2022 - General Webpage Update and Pygame Engine Progress

_Posted On: 9/20/2022_
_Edited On: 9/21/2022_

I've been a little distracted recently, so there's not much to report this week.

I've been focusing on LeetCode and job hunting, though I think I just suck at job hunting. 
I'm definitely not in a good position being out of college, but not having any internship experience.
I really hope it won't continue to be as bad in the coming hiring fall season. 

Also, I've mostly been getting rejection emails the past few months ðŸ˜­.

_UPDATE: Fixed poor wording. 
Usually my first drafts always turn out as hot garbage. 
Not sure why, despite being a native English reader/writer.
I think I hit my head too frequently as a kid.
Definitely remember trying to jump into a tub from the toilet seat as a kid or jumping from couch to coffee table and failing multiple times._

## Pygame Cafe Game

The main focus so far was the game engine/framework.
It's a little weird trying to basically recreate features in Unity in Python, and it's more difficult trying to get them all connected together.
I've been struggling to think of a good way to handle user interaction.
My current initial idea is to apply something similar to Flux, where there's a dispatcher class.
Related storage objects that require user inputs will be registered under the dispatcher class if specified in the JSON game storage syntax.

Below is a first draft attempt domain diagram (DDL) that I made to mock it up, though I left it largely incomplete since I couldn't figure out how to piece many of the parts together.
I'll be writing some use cases to help figure out the flow.

### Additional Features

I tend to get really distracted when designing stuff.
I really want to add a bunch of cool unnecessary features that might be excessive, but I'll outline some of them here.
Aside from the normal Stardew Valley-esque tile based world and movement mechanics.

I wanted to add 2D bone rigging, so I can create live 2D style movement. 
This requires a state based bone rigged sprite with position, rotation, and orientation.
Each body part also requires multiple version of the 2D part at different angles that can swap smoothly without too much jumping.
I've been thinking about have some stretching, so maybe UV mapping the parts into the screen.

I've also been thinking about dynamic lighting for 2D worlds.
There are some interesting examples I've seen online, where people use another image layer to generate directional intensity of light on an object based on the direction. 
So a video I saw used 4 colors to determine up, down, left, and right on a pixel 2d table, and the light intensity on the object seemed to be calculated based on the position and direction relative to the table. 

State machines are sorta weird. 
I worked with them once in Unity, but it seems hard to integrate with the code.
My question is whether state is stored in the state machine itself, or in the object it's latched on to.
If it's stored in the object, then how does the state machine detect changes or change without having to check every for loop iteration? Do I have to have all mutator functions check and call for the state machine to update every time a change occurs? Is it more efficient to have it just be called in the for loop to update check, since multiple mutations can occur per frame?
If it's stored independently in the state machine, how would I mutate the state machine from the sprite itself?
How would the state machine change the state of the object? I guess it would make the sprite highly coupled to the state machine, so that might not be as viable. 
There's also the issue that state machines are used both for graphics and for AI controlling.
I'll need to think more on how to allow the state machine to interface with certain objects and handle certain AI behaviors.

## Blog Style Update

I'm still thinking ways to enhance the blog pages. 
I've recently been messing around with CSS for formatting the main content, but I wanted to add additional features such as progress bars, canvas games, and random tools to the webpage. 
I'll try some more CSS stuff this week, and if I'm still not happy with the changes to the format of my webpages, then I'll do the nuclear option of creating my own variation of markdown. 
I'll create a UWP text editor to accompany this nuclear option if it really is that bad, although I make no guarantees on it since I'm also learning to write UWP apps as well in the mean time.

Honestly, this is a last resort issue, cause I don't really want to spend time to rewrite some of this code all
over again. If I do go nuclear, I'll change the format of the markdown document so I can add progress bars, time
stamps, and subject tags so I can search and filter through posts. I also plan on adding a left navigational bar
for tutorials I write as well, so that might benefit from this restructuring.

Also, I procrastinated too long in writing the github blog tutorial, so I apologize to anyone if they were
actually looking forward to such a thing. I'll do it in a few days... Maybe...

### Additional Features to Add

* Left drawer navigation for tutorials
* Code boxes that change dynamically with light and dark
* Code boxes with highlighted text, similar to IDEs
* Collapseable sections
* Image zoom w/ dynamic read for large images and no hover for small images
* Random hidden canvas doggo game
* Leetcode matrix visualizer
* Random Tools Section + a format to easily make tools so I don't worry about it
* Maybe markdown to code integration (not safe against XSS attacks, but I am the only person writing stuff here.)

## Getting into Kotlin and Android Development

I think I have a really short attention span. I started learning Kotlin today, but I think I might drop
it for now. Adroid app development is similar to UWP in that weird XML style UI creation, but I really didn't
like how confusing it was to try to connect my code to my UI interface. 
At least when I was reading a blog post on it.
It lost me in a few minutes.
I might try it again later, since I wanted to make a bookmark app for organizing the webpages I go to regularly and write my own reviews of random comics I read online. 

Anyways, I have some notes on Kotlin. It seems weird that it's similar to a lot of languages, like Python3, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java (cause it is backwards compatible with it), so honestly it's not too much of a jump going from Python + Java to Kotlin.

### Kotlin Notes

* variables aren't directly type defined. It's similar to JavaScript, but it takes sort of a TypeScript syntax approach with slight variations.
    * e.g. ```var varName: String = "Hello Grandma"```
    * also ```var``` is read and write access, while ```val``` is read only access.
    * type specification is not necessary, since it can implicitly detect the type.
* Has basic primitive types, but they start with capital letters?
    * String
    * Double
    * Int
    * Boolean
* semicolons are optional and advised against. Also, just learned that JavaScript semicolons are optional, and they'll automatically add it in even if you don't.
* No ```System.out.println("Hello World")```, instead it's just ```PrintLn("Hello World")```. (Might be capitalied or not, OneNote capitalizes all my lines so the P may or may not be capitalized.)
* Array and Linked List data structure initialization is funky.
    * ```listOf("entry1", "entry2")``` is a read only list. 
* It's 9:21pm and all motivation has been sucked out. Meh, don't really want to dump more useless programming notes here.
* It's 8:08am and I still don't want to dump my random programming notes here.

## UWP Encrypted Text Editor App 

Progress has stalled. I've just been very lazy. PBKDF2 hashing is used for passwords and that I'll need to add salt to the hash as well. I've been thinking if the salt should just be a statically set array of bytes or if it is safer to use another hashing algorithm to hash the password into a salt sequence? I've also been thinking about where to store the login file. 
I was thinking it could just be a text file with just the hash password stored in it, but maybe it should be stored in where all windows passwords are stored?

Maybe not, after reading this [Stack Exchange Post](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/113295/location-of-password-hashes-on-a-windows-local-machine) on where windows stores their passwords, the location
of security doesn't seem to matter as much, because it's an easy to recognize storage location for passwords. 
It might be better to stick it in a random location to obfuscate hackers a bit.

## Random Webpage Project

I guess I'm working on a webpage in React, Redis, and Express. Although, I have a few ideas on what to make.
The tutorials for React and Express usually focus on MongoDB, so I might use that initially for the project
instead. It's just a little weird going from just React front end to server side as well. It might take some 
getting used to, but I'll update my progress here. Luckily, I got a docker server set up, so now I can finally start using some database services from my home network.

## Docker Reflection

Honestly, it's really simple if you're setting it up for personal usage. It's really a way to run multiple machines on one machine, and I'm currently using it to run git tea and a minecraft server on my old laptop. I just hope that the battery doesn't die on me for having it plugged in 24/7. 

## Leet Code

I totally forgot to mention this. I've been making steady progress on Leet Code problems
and I've been getting better at depth first search and breadth first search problems, 
though I feel like some breadth first search problems require Tuples or classes to be
queued, which I don't like doing. Messy stuff. 

I started making more progress after my older brother introduced me to this webpage.
[https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=26&hours=20](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=26&hours=20)

You can tweak the settings to however you want. I just set it nearly to the max since I've
literally got nothing better to do at the moment.
