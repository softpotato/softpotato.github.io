# 9/20/2022 - General Webpage Update and Pygame Engine Progress

I've been a little distracted recently. I've been working mostly
on LeetCode and job hunting, though recently I've had a bad string
of luck on not really finding any jobs in my area and given my lack of experience. 
I'm not too sure how much I really want to move to move out of the pacific north west 
without a driver's license, but I'll consider it in a month or 2 after I pass the
driver's test. 

Definitely not fun recieving only rejection emails for the past few months though ðŸ˜­.

## Pygame Engine

I've been focusing on the game engine for the project. Figuring out how user interactions cascade
changes throughout the system is a little mind boggling for me, especially when it feels like
everything is sorta independent. It seems weird to connect all the classes together. I've been
going through the motions of project designing, but I feel like I might be overthinking certain
parts or reinventing the wheel for many part of this project. 

I guess this is my first draft attempt of a domain diagram on the engine. I've been thinking about
Lua script extensions and maybe multiplayer support, but I'll deal with those in the future later on.

_Figure 1: Domain Diagram of Pygame Engine. Sorry for the poor image zoom mechanic. I'm still trying to figure out a good css solution to this issue of giant images. Also, still uncertain if this is an engine or a Framework._

The engine is intended to allow me to easily create simple sprite tile map games. I plan on having some
form of bone rigging so I can easily have 2d animated characters, though I want to make something like
live2D's 2d 3d-esque characters. I was thinking that it maps a 2d image to some sort of 2d triangle geometry
as well as alters the image being rendered based on certain state parameters such as position and orientation.
I've also been thinking about dynamic lighting for 2d characters, since they've always seemed weird or flat
for me. I've come across some examples of people using a technique using a layered image to represent the 
intensity of a given direction on a sprite using sorta fake 3d direction layers. Not sure how to describe
it, but it looks cool and I might have some ideas on how to implement it.

## Blog Style Update

I'm still thinking about a way to enhance the webpages. I've recently been messing around with the CSS, but I
wanted to add additional features such as progress bars, random widgets, and random tools to the webpage. I'll
try CSS stuff this week, and if I'm still not happy with the changes to the format of my webpages, then I'll
do the nuclear option of creating my own variation of markdown. I'll create a UWP text editor to accompany this
nuclear option if it really is that bad, although I make no guarantees on it since I'm still semi-learning/randomly
picking it up at the same time.

Honestly, this is a last resort issue, cause I don't really want to spend time to rewrite some of this code all
over again. If I do go nuclear, I'll change the format of the markdown document so I can add progress bars, time
stamps, and subject tags so I can search and filter through posts. I also plan on adding a left navigational bar
for tutorials I write as well, so that might benefit from this. 

Also, I procrastinated too long in writing the github blog tutorial, so I apologize to anyone if they were
actually looking forward to such a thing. I'll do it in a few days... Maybe...

### Additional Features to Add

* Left Drawer for tutorials
* Code boxes that change dynamically with light and dark
* Code boxes with highlighted text
* Collapseable sections
* Image zoom w/ dynamic read for large images and no hover for small images
* Random hidden canvas doggo game
* Leetcode matrix visualizer
* Random Tools Section + a format to easily make tools so I don't worry about it
* Maybe markdown to code integration (not safe against XSS attacks, but then again I am the only content maker here)

## Getting into Kotlin and Android Development

I think I have a really short attention span. I started learning Kotlin today, but I think I might drop
it for now. Adroid app development is similar to UWP in that weird XML style UI creation, but I really fell in the 
pithole when I started reading on different ways to bind code to UI elements. Very messy stuff that I didn't want to read at the moment.

I mostly wanted to create a special bookmark app for organizing webpages I read often on my phone. It would be
useful to be able to query my collection of webpages and access it like a phone, so that's why I'm sorta doing this
project. I might integrate it with FireBase for the heck of it later on, but for now I'll just focus on setting up simple card grid layout that you can add URL links, ratings, tags, and other metatdata information on bookmarks you have.

Anyways, I have some notes going from Java/Python/JavaScript/C++ to Kotlin. Personally, if feels like a weird
mix of JavaScript and Python3 stuff. Maybe TypeScript, but I still need to pick that up as well. Here are my
notes on it so far after watching a few minutes in a random YouTube tutorial. You should probably watch it
yourself, but I'm mostly recording it here for my benefit later on so I can cringe at all the mistakes and later
reflect on things that I didn't know.

### Kotlin Notes

* variables aren't directly type defined. It's similar to JavaScript, but it takes sort of a TypeScript syntax approach with slight variations.
    * e.g. ```var varName: String = "Hello Grandma"```
    * also ```var``` is read and write access, while ```val``` is read only access.
    * type specification is not necessary, since it can implicitly detect the type.
* Has basic primitive types, but they start with capital letters?
    * String
    * Double
    * Int
    * Boolean
* semicolons are optional and advised against. Also, just learned that JavaScript semicolons are optional, and they'll automatically add it in even if you don't.
* No ```System.out.println("Hello World")```, instead it's just ```PrintLn("Hello World")```. (Might be capitalied or not, OneNote capitalizes all my lines so the P may or may not be capitalized.)
* Array and Linked List data structure initialization is funky.
    * ```listOf("entry1", "entry2")``` is a read only list. 
* It's 9:21pm and all motivation has been sucked out. Meh, don't really want to dump more useless programming notes here.

## UWP Encrypted Text Editor App 

Progress has stalled. I've just been very lazy. PBKDF2 hashing is used for passwords and that I'll need to salt the password as well. I've been thinking if the salt should just be a statically set array of bytes or if it is safer to use another hashing algorithm to hash the password into a salt sequence? I've also been thinking about where to 
store the login file. I was thinking it could just be a text file with just the hash password stored in it, but 
maybe it should be stored in where all windows passwords are stored?

Maybe not, after reading this [Stack Exchange Post](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/113295/location-of-password-hashes-on-a-windows-local-machine) on where windows stores their passwords, the location
of security doesn't matter. Also, it's not like I'm storing the password plain text.

## Random Webpage Project

I guess I'm working on a webpage in React, Redis, and Express. Although, I have a few ideas on what to make.
The tutorials for React and Express usually focus on MongoDB, so I might use that initially for the project
instead. It's just a little weird going from just React front end to server side as well. It might take some 
getting used to, but I'll update my progress here.

## Docker Reflection

Honestly, it's really simple if you're setting it up for personal usage. It's really a way to run multiple machines on one machine, and I'm currently using it to run git tea and a minecraft server on my old laptop. I just hope that the batteyr doesn't die on me for having it plugged in 24/7. 

## Leet Code

I totally forgot to mention this. I've been making steady progress on Leet Code problems
and I've been getting better at depth first search and breadth first search problems, 
though I feel like some breadth first search problems require Tuples or classes to be
queued, which I don't like doing. Messy stuff. 

I started making more progress after my older brother introduced me to this webpage.
[https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=26&hours=20](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=26&hours=20)

You can tweak the settings to however you want. I just set it nearly to the max since I've
literally got nothing better to do at the moment.
