# Random Scheduling Thoughts & Blog Tutorial Update

_Posted: 8/15/2022_

## Weekly Scheduling Idea

I'm not sure how to approach my unlimited free time while searching for a job.
I have 2 approaches I have in mind, which is to schedule hour by hour or to just have a set of goals outlined for the week and manage them day by day.
I'll call these 2 approaches as the following.

1) **Approach 1:** hour by hour scheduling
2) **Approach 2:** goal set week

I'll measure these and record them on a ```.csv``` file and evaluate the efficacy of the 2 approaches.
I'll start with approach 2 this week, since I'm feeling a little lazy.

## Blog Post Tutorial

I've gotten started writing the blog post github tutorial.
This is the current draft so far, so have fun reading.
I'll add a disquis to it later so people can comment questions if necessary, though I'm not sure if anyone is interested since I'm the only reader so far since I started this devlog/blog thingy.
