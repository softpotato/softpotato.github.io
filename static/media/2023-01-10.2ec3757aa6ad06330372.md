# Minetest Compiling with VCPKG, Visual Studio, and CMake built in

_Created: December 10th, 2023_

_Updated: December 10th, 2023_

I've been recently learning how to set up my development environment for Minetest, an open source Minecraft project. 
However, I disliked that to create the build directory. You had to open a CMake tool and convert your source files into build files in a separate directory, then open the build directory, and run it in in Visual Studio.

This honestly is a minor irritation, but luckily Visual Studio resolves this by having CMake built into the IDE. This post is mostly for people trying to figure out how to set it up and configure their builds within Visual Studio.

## Assumptions

This is not a full tutorial. This is a slight modification on Minetest's build instructions to optimize a better work flow for Visual Studio.

This tutorial assumes you already have Visual Studio 17 2022, VCPKG, Minetest's git repo cloned, the VCPKG files downloaded, and VCPKG should be hooked up and initialized to Visual Studio. I'm using Visual Studio Community edition, cause no money. You should use the latest version possible, because built in CMake seems to be a pretty recent feature only for the latest Visual Studio version. 

If you don't have any of the previous setup, you can either follow this YouTube tutorial for it [https://youtu.be/B4QnlJozFoM](https://youtu.be/B4QnlJozFoM) or you can read the previous post I made a while ago on VCPKG setup for SDL2, omitting the SDL2 file download command. Mintest's  GitHub README page also has compiling instructions. For any of the above recommendations, just omit the part when they start mentioning CMake GUI. That's where this tutorial comes in.

## Step 1 - Installing the CMake Tools

_Too lazy to include images_

Within the __Visual Studio Installer__, select __modify__. The C++ CMake tools are found under the __Desktop & Mobile__ section on the group button __Desktop Development with C++__. Make sure that under that, the option of _C++ CMake tools for Windows_ is selected.

If you want to compile to a Linux environment, you might need to select the __Linux and embedded development in C++__ under __Other Toolsets__ as well. Visual Studio will show a menu on more related to Linux compiling, but I digress. 

Once you're happy, select the __modify__ button in the bottom right of the menu and wait for installation to finish.

## Step 2 - Configuring the CMake .json settings

Visual Studio will automatically detect and run your CMakeLists.txt, however, a few additional configuration steps are necessary.

Select __Project__ the top left corner dropdown lists (it should be the 5th from the left). 
If it detected your CMakeList.txt, then the option `CMake Settings for <Project name>` should appear. 
If it didn't then either wait a bit and check, maybe select the CMakeLists.txt, or recheck your downloads to verify you have the latest Visual Studio version and proper downloaded settings mentioned in the previous step.

Then the following window should show up.

Your file will look different on your first time opening. Change the corresponding fields to try to match mine.

* Change _Configuration type_ to __Release__.
* We can assume the toolchain is already hooked up to VCPKG, unless you didn't initialize it properly.
* You might want to change _build root_ to `${projectDir}\build\${name}` so the `.gitignore` will filter it out on git commits.
* Set the _CMake command arguments_ to `-DENABLE_GETTEXT=OFF -DENABLE_CURSES=OFF` cause the Github docs for minetest say to include this in the command. Not sure what it does, but it belongs there I guess.
* (Optional) Within _CMake variables and cache_. In the scroll down list, select the __REQUIRE_LUAJIT__ option. I saw it in that youtube video mentioned previously, and they mentioned a faster in time compilier or something. IDK.
* (FORGOT TO INCLUDE IMAGE) Click the _Show advanced settings_ button and under _CMake generator_. Change the setting to your target Visual Studio system, so in my case __Visual Studio 17 2022 Win64__.

If all things go well, then you should start seeing output text spew out from CMake showing failed to find some stuff and success. It seems they have Redis and a few other database type systems within the CMake file that isn't absolutely necessary.

If it doesn't spew out text after you save it, you can try running the CMake by selecting the `CMakeLists.txt` file and pressing the green button on top. I'm not sure if this is actually how you're supposed to activate it, but it worked for me at the time.

I think it should then automatically convert the build directory from time to time, so you can leave it be for now.

## Step 3 - Finding and Compiling the Build Directory

So with CMake setup, we just need to navigate to the build directory and run it.

In the __Solution Explorer__, select the purpose visual studio icon with a text of paper in the background button. Then select _CMake Targets View_. You should be able to see all the CMake builds.

Then, simply open the `minetest (executable)` dropdown and select main. You should see that the green button at top has changed to something else, in which it will compile and run the game.

I didn't take a photo of what the actual button says, but it should not say what's on this image. I'm a little too lazy to bother updating this image.

Yay! You're done!
