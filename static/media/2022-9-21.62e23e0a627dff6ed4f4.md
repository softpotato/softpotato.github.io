# 9-21-2022 Blog Post Update

I’m going to write all blog posts in google documents first, then proofread and convert them to the blog. After some reflection on my previous blog posts, there are just too many grammatical errors and poorly phrased sentences. I’ll leave all previous posts as is, but hopefully the quality of my posts improves.

I might be a little rusty on writing, so hopefully this improves my writing skills. However, I’m more worried about my talking skills, since this isn't something I can normally work on at home.
