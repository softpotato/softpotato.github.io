# Game Webpage Progress Update 2

_Posted: 3/20/2023_

I was planning on writing this post Friday, then time slipped by and now it's Monday.

Not much progress was made last week.

I went through Vercel's official NextJS 12 blog tutorial.
Some interesting aspects about NextJS is that it organizes a project well and handles a lot more optimization steps for you.
It's also interesting that there is unique ways to fetch data, like build time fetching and on run time.
Although, it was a heck ton of information, that I'm hoping I remember a week down the line. 
Probably won't, and I'll have to search it up all over again.
Oh well.

After completing the tutorial, I created a simple landing page. 
There was a lot more stuff that happened before it, like creating a sketch up draft in one note.
Then I prototyped some of the designs in Figma.
Then I got to the actual programming, and just flopped like a fish.
All motivation lost.
I think it was because I didn't have an account system working, so I'd be making a front end webpage without any backend or logic to operate it properly.

That leads to this week, I'll be focusing on account system validation.
A major component of this webpage is having active user sessions being handled and monitored.
The reason a session is important is for the game to know if a user has dropped out, or they lost connection.
This way, the game can respond properly mostly by game admin intervention.

Also, I'll post screenshots of the webpage later this week. 
It's really just a simple landing page with a few icons I made using InkScape. 

## Unrelated Thoughts on Front End Development

On an unrelated note, I was exploring different front end portfolio, and it dawned on me.
I have no experience with creating a webpage focused on UI/UX experiences.
I only have experiences with either making simple formats with Material UI, or developing user interactions with a canvas element.

Thus, I decided to explore how to get more into UI/UX theory and design.
I didn't find any good books to read, since I realized that my attention span is too short to read a textbook.
Instead, I decided to start creating wire-frames and design mockups in Figma. 
I have no idea what I'm doing, but I feel like an artist.

I also decided to pick back up SVG art.
I'm channelling my inner freshman high school knowledge of creating that SVG ladybug in high school.

## Trashing a 3D graphics book

I'm not going to point out names, but I decided to finally give up reading a textbook on realtime rendering.
The book is written for people more oriented towards graduate school type level of education, who's primary field is both mathematics and 3d graphics.
That book was filled with so much jargon, research article citations, and math theory.
It just melted my brain.
Like kaput, cheese.

I'm just going to follow a different tutorial with a more hands on approach to learn OpenGL instead.
Screw textbooks.

I'm planning on making a Minecraft house designing software, so people can make houses like in the Sims.
I love the sims. 

## Minecraft Castle

This is completely unrelated to anything on this blog, but I wanted to show off something I've been working on for a few months on.
It helps me calm down and stop panicking that I'm a jobless bum living at home leeching off my parents.

Although, this is probably not the greatest use of my time. 
I only work on it when my brain goes kaput.
