# Creating Your Own GitHub Blog

I need to update the structure of my blog to
allow users to read individual posts before I 
can start writing this. This is a simple post
that I'll write that will guide a user through
using React and MUIv5 to create their own blog
and different customization features you can do
to extend or enrich the page.

This is my first time writing a blog and I'll
be learning some parts as I'm writing this as 
well. When I get this page up, I hope you'll 
join me on my journey through front end webpage
design.
