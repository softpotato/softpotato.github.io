I recently set up a C++ build using Visual Studio, Vcpkg, and SDL2.
And wow, it was a roller coaster ride today. 
I just want to share some setup instructions in case you're like me and decided to use Vcpkg to install SDL2 and just want a simple working build guide.

## Issue with SDL2 installation using Vcpkg

So if you already have Vcpkg setup and SDL2 installed, then follow this Stack Overflow solution to finish setting up the project. If you don't, then start from the section below. I'll also add my own screenshots and explanation for the issue below as well, since I know how painful it is to navigate Visual Studio. This link is mostly to intercept people trying to solve the problem and don't care to read through this post.

## Setting up SDL2 on Visual Studio using Vcpkg

The following is a series of setup instructions for creating a working SDL2 C++ project in Visual Studio.

### What is Vcpkg?

Vcpkg is a package manager. 
It's sorta like Node Package Manager (NPM), if you're familiar with that.
In general, it's a great way to download slightly more authenticated/official code binaries to use with your C++ projects.
What I like about it is 2 reasons.
1) It's made by Microsoft, so it just pairs well with Visual Studio.
2) It has slightly more official binaries, so you don't need to worry about dead random code bases like in NPM. They mention something similar with Conan (an alternative to Vcpkg) in their FAQs, so I'd definitely check out their page.

### What is Visual Studio

Visual Studio is Microsoft's Integrated Development Editor (IDE). It specializes in targeting their system and libraries, so I'd suggest using it if you're primarily aiming to develop Windows applications.

In my opinion, it seems like it focuses too much on their application.
As a result, their UI suffers a lot from too many buttons and features that aren't as extensible for other applications like React and JavaScript.
However, I like using it since it seems to sort of mask some of the boiler plate of compilation.
And for what it's designed for, it usually performs really well once you can get through the terrible boilerplate errors.

### What is SDL2

Quoting the official docs, "Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D."

Many people use it for video games, and that's my intention as well. I want to make a cafe game, sorta similar to Stardew Valley.

### Setting Up Visual Studio

I'm using Visual Studio Community 2022 edition. 
If you're using a later or an earlier version (maybe at the minimum, version 2015), then this tutorial should be fine.

Install the official Visual Studio from Microsoft's page.

[https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

Any version is fine, but the community one is the only free one (and I still don't have a bank account). Install it, and at some point you should reach a screen similar to the one below.

What you want to select is the **Desktop development with C++**. You can also selected the **Game development with Unity** if you have Unity, since it pairs well with it, but that's irrelevant to this tutorial.

You don't need to do anything else with this for now once it's installed.

### Installing and Setting up Vcpkg

Find a folder to store the files in.
The official docs suggest to put in a drive in a folder like ```C:\dev``` or ```C:\src``` to prevent any path issues. I keep mine in ```C:\dev``` since I usually assume a ```src``` folder is something I shouldn't touch normally.

To install the package manager itself, you'll need Git.
Vcpkg is really a git repo at [https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), so you can simply do the following if you have Git.

```Powershell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
```

If you don't have Git and you don't want to install git, then you can download through .zip (which I highly advise against) and unpack it. The downside of this way is that you can't update Vcpkg manager that easily.


Run the Bootstrap script to build vcpkg.

```powershell
.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```

Once this is done, run the command to integrate with Visual Studio.

```powershell
vcpkg integrate install
```

Note: There are some outputs that Vcpkg makes related to CMake. If your project uses CMake or you plan on using it later on to port it to Linux, then I'd suggest you save those commands in a text file for later.

### Installing SDL2 .dll Version

To simplify navigation, enter the vcpkg folder so we don't need to reference ```.\vcpkg\```. From here, we'll be referencing an EXE when we use ```.\vcpkg```.

To install SDL2, simply type in

```powershell
.\vcpkg install SDL2
```

That is pretty much all you have to do with Vcpkg. Visual Studio should be configured to use the package as is, but there is a slight catch to it. We need to manually reference the main library in SDL2. As to why, I don't know why they decided this, but they did.

If you want to use a static library, you might have to figure that out yourself. I have no intention at the moment to learn that. The following steps are not necessary if you install a static library variant.

#### Specifying 64 bit binaries

There are 2 ways to specify 32 or 64 bit binaries. By default, it's 32 (x86), so we'll either need to do one of the following to change that.

1) Alter Environment Variables by adding the value to ```VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET``` in user variables and setting it's value to ```=x64-windows```. This permanently installs 64 bit binaries.
2) Manually specify ```--triplet x64-windows``` in install whenever you do an install.

#### Should you install Dynamic or Static SDL2

SDL has a great post on the matter. [https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/docs/README-dynapi.md](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/docs/README-dynapi.md). 

It seems depending on the intended release platform, it might vary. Steam seems to favor using .dlls, since they can provide one that will make sure it keeps running.

Other platforms might want you to make it a single .exe bundle, so static might be better for them.

There are also other maybe legal issues, but I sorta didn't read that stuff.

### Setting up Test Code

The following is a good copy and paste code to make sure everything is working. Create a blank C++ app, then put this code into a file title ```main.cpp```. This will be where the code first starts reading.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "SDL2/SDL.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
	SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING);
	SDL_Window* window = SDL_CreateWindow(
		"title", 
		SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED, 
		SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED, 
		600, 
		400, 
		SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN
		);
	SDL_Renderer* renderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(window, -1, 0);
	SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, 0, 255, 0, 255);
	SDL_RenderClear(renderer);
	SDL_RenderPresent(renderer);
	SDL_Delay(3000);
	std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

_Sorry for the weird code paste format. I'm still figuring out a good CSS style for multi code lines._

If you run it, you'll get errors. We'll fix the errors in the following section.

### Adding Manual Imports

So you've reached this point. 
It took me a day to figure out the issue, so hopefully this makes your experience easier. I eventually resolved it when I found this Stack Overflow post, which you can use instead [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64079180/vs-auto-linking-against-sdl2-libraries-installed-with-vcpkg-on-windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64079180/vs-auto-linking-against-sdl2-libraries-installed-with-vcpkg-on-windows). The following is a more visual version, which I hope is a good supplemental to the original post.

Vcpkg has some files that require manual imports (e.g. you have to add their references manually every time you start a new project). Sadly, SDL2 is one of those. It requires the ```SDL2maind.lib``` for Debug mode and ```SDL2main.lib``` for release mode.

It's a little tedious, but you only have to tweak 4 settings for your project.

Open your project folder and head to the menus on the top left corner. Select **Project >  properties**

![Properties toolbar image](vcpkg-img2.jpg)

Mine says "GameEngine", but yours will say the project name.

For convenience, when I say it's a _debug_, then you need to switch the following to _debug_.
If I say it's _release_, then you need to save the previous mode and swap it to _release_.

![Build Type Menu Swapper](vcpkg-img3.jpg)

In the menu, head to **VC++ Directories > Library Directories > Select the 3 dots on the right**. 

![VC++ Directory Navigation](vcpkg-img4.jpg)

Swap the mode to _debug_ and insert the line at the highlighted blue zone ```$(VcpkgRoot)\installed\$(VcpkgTriplet)\debug\lib\manual-link\```.

![Release Paste](vcpkg-img5.jpg)

Save/apply, then repeat this step for _release_.

For _release_, insert the line 

```$(VcpkgRoot)\installed\$(VcpkgTriplet)\lib\manual-link\```.

We added the library dependency references, now we have to add the actual file to expect for the linker. Navigate to **Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies**.

![Linker Dependency Image](vcpkg-img6.jpg)

Now for _debug_ mode, add ```SDL2maind.lib``` into the **Additional Dependencies** line.

Similarly for _release_ mode, add ```SDL2main.lib``` into **Additional Dependencies** line.

Now you should be able to run the code previously shown, huzzah!
